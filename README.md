# SpamFinder
In this project we will explore text message data and create models to predict if a message is spam or not.

Basically, we will start with a simple model and simple features. As we progress, we make more informative features to our model. For the best result, see the last section which has 3 extra features.

the data we are given is spam.csv which is available in this repositary
